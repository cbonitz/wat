\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Automatically computing the \watprovenance{} of a black box is infeasible
    because it requires a complex code analysis of the black box's
    \emph{implementation}.
  \item
    Fortunately, many black box components have simple \emph{interfaces}, even
    if they have complex implementations.
  \item
    A \defword{\watprovenance{} specification} is a function that given a trace
    $T$ and input $i$, directly returns the \watprovenance{} of $i$.
    \Watprovenance{} specifications are written against a system's interface
    (simple) instead of its implementation (complex).
  \item
    Examples of black boxes with simple \watprovenance{} specifications include
    key-value stores, object stores, distributed file systems, coordination
    services, load balancers, and stateless services.
\end{itemize}
