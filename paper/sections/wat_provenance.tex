\subsection{A Motivating Example}\seclabel{WatProvenanceExample}
% We claim that there is currently no \emph{principled} way to reason about the
% causes of events in a heterogenous distributed system. To best understand why,
% let's look at a simple example. Consider a distributed implementation of sparse
% stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based on Hogwild!~\cite{recht2011hogwild}
% coordinated via a parameter server~\cite{li2014scaling}, as illustrated in
% \figref{ParameterServer}. We store our weight vector $x$ in a parameter server
% with each entry $x_i$ keyed by index $i$. We have a set of worker servers that
% periodically compute a gradient on a batch of the training data and push their
% updates to $x$ back to the parameter server. As the SGD executes, a data
% scientist's laptop periodically pulls the weights from the parameter server,
% computes the training error, and displays it to the data scientist so that they
% can monitor the progress of the SGD.

\subsection{Properties}

Begin by critiquing causality and why provenance. Now that we know what they are, this should be clear.

then state our objective. we would like to define provenance for arbitrary state machines.
definitions are asserted, not proved. we'll have to look at examples to get a sense
(1) sufficient and minimal
(2) any superset is sufficient
(3) set of witnesses, not just one thing

this is wat provenance
