  There is currently no systematic way to reason about the fine-grained causes
  of events in a real-world distributed system. Causality, from the distributed
  systems literature, can be used to compute the causal history of an arbitrary
  event in a distributed system, but the causal history of an event is a vast
  overapproximation of the true causes. Data provenance, from the database
  literature, describes precisely the cause of a particular output of a
  relational query, but data provenance is limited to the domain of static
  relational databases. In this paper, we present \defword{\watprovenance{}}: a
  novel form of provenance that provides the benefits of causality and data
  provenance. Given an arbitrary time-varying state machine, \watprovenance{}
  describes why the state machine produces a particular output when given a
  particular input. This enables system developers to systematically reason
  about the causes of events in real-world distributed systems. We observe that
  automatically extracting the \watprovenance{} of a state machine is often
  infeasible and sometimes impossible, depending on the state machine.
  Fortunately, many distributed systems components have simple interfaces from
  which a developer can directly specify \watprovenance{} using a technique we
  call \defword{\watprovenance{} specifications}. Leveraging the theoretical
  foundations of \watprovenance{}, we implement a prototype distributed
  debugging framework called \fluent{} and empirically demonstrate that
  \watprovenance{} makes debugging distributed systems significantly easier
  than what is possible with existing techniques.
