\section{Introduction}\seclabel{Introduction}
Debugging distributed systems is hard. Traditional debugging techniques are
poorly suited to distributed systems in which bugs arise due to chains of logic
that often span multiple concurrent nodes connected by an unreliable network that can
drop, duplicate, and reorder messages. Distributed debugging tools do
exist but are largely in their infancy. They help tame \emph{some} of the
complexities of distributed debugging, but have limited applicability to
real-world distributed systems that are made up of a large number of complex
components. Consequently, developers are often forced to perform ad-hoc root
cause analysis in order to find the source of a bug, stitching together the
logs of multiple concurrently executing nodes.

Worse, we argue that existing formalisms are also inadequate to reason about
systematically debugging real-world distributed systems. For example, consider
causality~\cite{lamport1978time}. Causality is a general-purpose formalism that
specifies the \emph{causal history} of a particular event in an arbitrary
distributed system. However, causality is too general-purpose as it fails to
incorporate any semantics of the underlying distributed system beyond opaque
message-passing~\cite{bailis2012potential}. As a consequence, the causal
history of an event is an overapproximation of the cause of the event. It
includes all the events that \emph{might} have caused a particular event
instead of the events that \emph{actually do} cause it.

Alternatively, consider data provenance in the form of
\emph{\whyprovenance{}}~\cite{cheney2009provenance, buneman2001and}. Given a
relational database, a query issued against the database, and a tuple in the
output of the query, the \whyprovenance{} of the output explains why the output
tuple was produced. That is, it provides the input tuples which, if passed
through the relational operators of the query, would produce the output in
question. In contrast to causality, data provenance heavily incorporates the
semantics of relational databases and queries in order to describe
\emph{precisely} the cause of a particular output. However, \whyprovenance{}
makes the critical assumption that the underlying relational database is
static. It cannot handle the time-varying nature of stateful distributed
systems. Moreover, data provenance is limited to the domain of relational data
and cannot easily be applied to other system components (e.g., load balancers,
file systems, coordination services, etc.).

In short, \textbf{causality lacks a notion of data dependence, and data
provenance lacks a notion of time}. In this paper, we present
\defword{\watprovenance{}} (why-across-time provenance): a novel form of data
provenance that unifies ideas from the two. \Watprovenance{} generalizes
\whyprovenance{} from the domain of relational queries issued against a static
database to the domain of arbitrary time-varying state machines in a
distributed system. More specifically, given a deterministic state machine, the
sequence of inputs that the state machine has processed, and a particular input
to the state machine, \watprovenance{} formalizes \emph{why} the state machine
produces the output that it does. This description includes a set of
subsequences of the input trace that are both necessary and sufficient to
generate the output in question.  Borrowing from causality, \watprovenance{}
can be applied to time-varying state machines. Borrowing from \whyprovenance{},
\watprovenance{} incorporates state machine semantics to avoid
overapproximating provenance and instead returns \emph{precisely} the inputs
that cause a particular output.

After we define \watprovenance{}, we turn to the matter of computing it. We
observe that automatically extracting the \watprovenance{} of a state machine
is often infeasible or impossible, depending on the state machine.  Computing
the \watprovenance{} of a state machine is tantamount to inferring the state
machine's data dependencies using a very complex code analysis of the state
machine's source code. This source code can be both large and complex which
makes this code analysis infeasible. In the worst case, we cannot access the
state machine's source code at all! For example, many distributed systems
leverage cloud services, like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Spanner, that have
proprietary implementations.

Automatically extracting the \watprovenance{} of an \emph{arbitrary} state
machine might be hard or even impossible, but most distributed systems
components are far from arbitrary. Many distributed system components are
designed with simple and minimalistic APIs. We can take advantage of this
observation and sidestep the complexity of \emph{extracting} the
\watprovenance{} from the \emph{implementation} of a state machine and instead
\emph{specify} the \watprovenance{} from the \emph{interface} of a state
machine. To this end, we propose \defword{\watprovenance{} specifications}:
functions that directly encode the \watprovenance{} of state machine using its
interface instead of its implementation.  We describe the provenance
specifications of a number of widely used distributed systems components (i.e.\
Redis, Amazon S3, HDFS, Zookeeper) and find that in practice, they are
straightforward to implement.

Next, we present \fluent{}: a prototype distributed debugging framework that
leverages the formal foundations of \watprovenance{} and \watprovenance{}
specifications. \fluent{} includes a mechanism for developers to write
\watprovenance{} specifications that are executed against the input traces of
the components in a distributed system. We use \fluent{} to measure the
complexity of writing \watprovenance{} specifications and also compare
\fluent{} to existing distributed debugging frameworks. For a trivial Redis
workload, we find that \fluent{} generates provenance output that is \emph{four
orders of magnitude} more succinct than an existing state of the art debugging
tool which vastly overapproximates the provenance of a simple get request.

In summary, this paper presents the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    We define \watprovenance{}: a formalism that extends notions of data
    provenance to the realm of state machines in a distributed system. We also
    prove a pair of properties demonstrating the formalism's soundness.
  \item
    We present \watprovenance{} specifications: a mechanism to compute the
    \watprovenance{} of distributed system components for which automatically
    extracting the \watprovenance{} is otherwise intractable or impractical. We
    also describe the \watprovenance{} specification of a number of widely used
    distributed systems components, illustrating that \watprovenance{}
    specifications are straightforward to write in the common case.
  \item
    We implement the theoretical foundations of \watprovenance{} in a system
    called \fluent{} and demonstrate that \fluent{} can be used to debug
    distributed systems with significantly less effort that what is currently
    possible when using existing techniques.
\end{itemize}
