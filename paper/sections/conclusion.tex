\section{Conclusion}\seclabel{Conclusion}
This paper identified inadequacies in existing formalisms used to reason about
the causes of events in distributed systems. Causality overapproximates the
true cause of an event, and data provenance is restricted to the domain of
static (typically relational) data. We then presented \watprovenance{}: a novel
form of provenance that generalizes \whyprovenance{} and refines causality. We
then discussed how to sidestep the complexity of automatic \watprovenance{}
extraction with \watprovenance{} specifications written against the high-level
API of a black box.
% We concluded by presenting a prototype distributed debugger, \fluent{}, and
% qualitatively compared \fluent{} to other debugging techniques.
